<body>
<h1>The Left Hand Path</h1>
<h3>A wise man once told me the best way to get what you want is to manipulate the people around you and construct webs of lies to protect yourself from reality,<br>
safely keeping everyone who thinks they know you at arms reach and forcing yourself to be alone, but not lonely. To me, this also fits in with the ideas of the <br>
left hand path, the occult side to esotericism. After all, who doesn't wanna summon satan to do your bidding. By summoning satan I mean embracing your inner puppet<br>
master and making everyone in your menial life dance like puppets to the beat of your drum. By doing this, you can exert your will over the so called NPCs and climb<br>
your way up the corporate ladder or whatever you are trying to achieve. There is this societal hatred against the followers of the left hand path (sociopaths) because<br>
people do not like to be manipulated, but after all if you do it well enough they will never figure out that they are just peices on the chessboard left over from last<br>
weeks BBQ. Basically what I am trying to say is that you should spend your free time plotting against the system and those who care about you for entertainment or to <br>
advance closer to your plans for running an apocalyptic cult based out of Roswell, New Mexico.
